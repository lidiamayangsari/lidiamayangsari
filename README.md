#### Welcome to my GitHub Page!

Hello there! 👋 Thanks for stopping by. 

This page serves as the central hub for all information, documentation, and updates related to my ongoing projects or curiosities👀. 
Here, you'll find everything from source code to its latest releases and contributions.🌱

I am dedicated this page to explore prediction modelling in consumer behaviour 🛍️ 🛒, with a specific emphasis on food choice 🍽️🍚🍞🍠. 

Using the power of R, I delve into the nuances of consumer decisions ⚖️, providing valuable insights that can shape the future of food security 🌎 and choice architecture 💡. 
Additionally, I leverage `agentpy` in Python to construct intricate agent-based simulations, further enhancing our understanding of consumer dynamics in the realm of food choice.

#### Features:
- **Data-Driven Insights:** Harnessing the statistical power of R to predict and understand consumer behaviour.
- **Agent-Based Modelling:** Using `agentpy` to simulate and visualize complex consumer interactions in the food industry.
- **Open Source:** Everything here is transparent and free to use. Dive into the code, make changes, or propose improvements.
- **Well-documented:** I believe in the power of good documentation. Navigate through the resources to get started quickly.
- **Community-driven:** Contributions are the backbone of this initiative. Feel free to raise issues, submit pull requests, or suggest new ideas.
